Mapbox iOS SDK - McClintock Lab Version
--------------

TRB 6/14/2016: Mapbox deprecated this SDK long ago and recently even removed it from Github and the Cocoapods repo.  We still use it for eCatch and eFins, and we need to do periodic maintenance to the SDK to keep up with changing compilers/libraries/etc.  There is no upstream anymore so it's up to us.




**This tree of the Mapbox iOS SDK is deprecated in favor of the [Mapbox GL](http://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-gl-native)-based version 2.0.0 and above. The future of Mapbox maps is vector rendering, and 2.0.0 is a rewrite based on OpenGL ES and vector rendering.  Unlimited, per-user Mapbox pricing plans cannot be used with this version of the iOS SDK.**

See [this doc](README-old.markdown) for the original project details.
